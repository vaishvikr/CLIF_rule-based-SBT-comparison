# CLIF Rule based SAT comparison

## Objective

The aim of this project is to evaluate compliance in the delivery of SBT within healthcare settings. We have developed an algorithm that detects SBT events in Electronic Health Records (EHR) by identifying specific signatures. This algorithm allows for comparison of SAT occurrences with documented flowsheets to assess adherence to the SBT protocol.

## Required CLIF tables and fields

Please refer to the online [CLIF data dictionary](https://clif-consortium.github.io/website/data-dictionary.html), [ETL tools](https://github.com/clif-consortium/CLIF/tree/main/etl-to-clif-resources), and [specific table contacts](https://github.com/clif-consortium/CLIF?tab=readme-ov-file#relational-clif) for more information on constructing the required tables and fields. List all required tables for the project here, and provide a brief rationale for why they are required.

Example:

The following tables are required:

1. **patient**: `patient_id`, `race_category`, `ethnicity_category`, `sex_category`
2. **hospitalization**: `patient_id`, `hospitalization_id`, `admission_dttm`, `discharge_dttm`, `age_at_admission`
3. **medication_admin_continuous**: `hospitalization_id`, `admin_dttm`, `med_category`, `med_dose`
   - `med_category` = 'norepinephrine', 'epinephrine', 'phenylephrine', 'vasopressin','dopamine','dobutamine','milrinone','isoproterenol'
4. **respiratory_support**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `device_category`
5. **patient_assessments**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `assessment_category`,`numerical_value`, `categorical_value`
   - `assessment_category` = 'sbt_delivery_pass_fail','sbt_screen_pass_fail'
6. **vitals**: `hospitalization_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `vitals_category`, `vitals_value`

## Cohort identification

Study period: January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 (2 years) Inclusion criteria:

Patients with at least one ICU admission & IMV during the study period (2020-2021)
Age >= 18 years at the time of initial hospital admission

## Expected Results

Output: One table1 file and One stats file [`output/final`](../output/README.md)
